# BugWeight

**BugWeight** is a fast-paced 2D rogue-lite platformer developed in Unity. Inspired by *Vampire Survivors*, this game flips the roles‚Äî**you are the vampire**, and your goal is to survive endless swarms of insects.

The name *BugWeight* is a nod to the **Flyweight** design pattern used extensively in the game's architecture, alongside **Singletons** and **Object Pooling** for better performance and memory optimization.
